            Hi! My name is Emily, and I'm a freshman at Hillsdale High School! I was born in Cali, though it's always been my dream
            to live in Taiwan, where my parents were born. In my (scant) spare time, I do photography, write, and code sometimes.
            Coding has been a relatively new hobby for me, and I've probably spent more time on Stack Overflow than in the IDE, but
            in the end the reward feels pretty damn nice. Other than that... I'm not sure. I used to read more before I started 
            social media and got a smartphone, but I love Jane Austen's novels, especially Pride and Prejudice! My passions are
            fleeting and all over the place, I started playing badminton this year, which I love, and before, I played volleyball. Sometimes, I
            sing along to my guitar or piano, other times I'll paint and create. The quote that seems to be unpopular in colleges but one that
            (fortunately? unfortunately?) fits my story is " “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.”
